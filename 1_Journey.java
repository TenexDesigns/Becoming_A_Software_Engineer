Pursuing a career in software engineering through self-study is entirely possible, and many successful software engineers are self-taught. Here's a roadmap to help you on your journey to becoming a proficient software engineer:

**1. Define Your Goals:**
   - Start by defining your career goals. What specific areas of software engineering are you interested in? Web development, mobile app development, data science, machine learning, etc.? Having clear goals will help you focus your efforts.

**2. Learn the Basics:**
   - Start with the fundamentals of programming. Choose a programming language to begin with. Python, JavaScript, and Java are good options for beginners. Learn the syntax and basic concepts like variables, data types, loops, and conditionals.

**3. Online Resources:**
   - Utilize online resources such as Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, Coursera, edX, and Khan Academy to access structured courses and tutorials.

**4. Books:**
   - Consider investing in programming and computer science books. "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin, "Introduction to the Theory of Computation" by Michael Sipser, and "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma are recommended titles.

**5. Practice, Practice, Practice:**
   - Programming is a skill that improves with practice. Work on personal projects, solve coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank, and contribute to open-source projects on GitHub.

**6. Online Communities:**
   - Join online developer communities, such as Stack Overflow, Reddit's r/learnprogramming, and GitHub. Engaging with these communities can help you learn, collaborate, and get feedback on your work.

**7. Build a Portfolio:**
   - Create a portfolio to showcase your projects and skills. This is crucial for job applications. Include personal projects, open-source contributions, and any freelance work.

**8. Learn Data Structures and Algorithms:**
   - Understanding data structures and algorithms is essential for efficient coding and problem-solving. There are many online courses and books dedicated to this topic.

**9. Specialize:**
   - Once you've acquired a strong foundation, specialize in a particular area of software engineering that aligns with your goals. This could be web development (front-end, back-end), mobile app development (iOS, Android), data science, machine learning, etc.

**10. Version Control:**
   - Learn how to use version control systems like Git, which are crucial for collaborative software development.

**11. Learn About Software Engineering Practices:**
   - Study software engineering practices like code review, testing, and documentation. Understand the importance of clean, maintainable code.

**12. Networking:**
   - Attend local meetups, conferences, and tech events to network with other professionals and learn about industry trends.

**13. Create a Study Schedule:**
   - Consistency is key. Set a study schedule and stick to it. Allocate time for learning, coding, and building projects.

**14. Job Search:**
   - When you feel confident in your skills, start applying for jobs, internships, or freelance opportunities. Tailor your resume and cover letter to highlight your projects and skills.

**15. Continuous Learning:**
   - The tech industry evolves rapidly. Stay up-to-date by following tech blogs, news sites, and online courses.

**16. Work on Soft Skills:**
   - Communication, problem-solving, and teamwork are crucial in a professional environment. Develop these skills alongside your technical skills.

Remember that the journey to becoming a proficient software engineer is a marathon, not a sprint. Learning and improving your skills is an ongoing process. Be patient, stay motivated, and keep working on projects that interest you. Over time, your portfolio and experience will make you a competitive candidate in the software engineering field, even without a formal university education.
