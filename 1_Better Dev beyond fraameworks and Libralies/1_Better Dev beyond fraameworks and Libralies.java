Becoming proficient in programming goes beyond mastering a specific library or framework. While libraries and frameworks are important tools, they are not the core of programming. Understanding the fundamentals of programming, problem-solving, and being able to build complex tools are the foundational skills that make a great programmer.

Here are some skills and steps to develop them:

1. **Understanding Programming Fundamentals**: This includes understanding data types, control structures (like loops and conditional statements), functions, and algorithms. You can start by choosing a language and mastering it. Online platforms like Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, and Coursera offer courses from beginner to advanced levels that can help you understand these fundamentals [Source 19](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/3/how-do-you-improve-your-programming-skills), [Source 3](https://www.springboard.com/blog/software-engineering/programming-skills/).

2. **Problem-solving Skills**: This involves being able to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts, and then solving them step by step. This is a crucial skill for any programmer. You can improve this skill by practicing problem-solving on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Exercism.

3. **Understanding Data Structures and Algorithms**: These are the building blocks of programming. Understanding them will help you write more efficient and effective code. There are many resources online, including books, online courses, and YouTube tutorials, that can help you learn about data structures and algorithms.

4. **Building Projects**: Building your own projects is one of the best ways to learn and improve your programming skills. This could be anything from a simple tic-tac-toe game to a more complex web application. Building projects will help you apply the concepts you've learned and gain practical experience.

5. **Reading and Understanding Code**: Reading other people's code is another great way to improve your programming skills. It can help you understand different ways to solve problems and learn best practices. You can find open-source projects on platforms like GitHub and contribute to them.

6. **Learning About Different Paradigms**: Understanding different programming paradigms, like functional programming and object-oriented programming, can make you a more versatile programmer. Different paradigms have different strengths and weaknesses, and knowing when to use which one can be a valuable skill.

Remember, becoming proficient in programming is a journey that takes time and practice. Dont be discouraged if you find it challenging at first. Keep learning, keep practicing, and you'll get there [Source 0](https://bootcamp.du.edu/blog/programming-skills/), [Source 6](https://www.coursera.org/articles/how-to-become-a-computer-programmer).

  A programmer should indeed focus on developing a strong foundation in the fundamentals of programming before relying heavily on specific libraries or frameworks. Mastery of the core concepts of programming languages, algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques will enable you to tackle a wide range of programming tasks and adapt to new technologies more effectively.

Here are the key skills you should strive for as a programmer:

1. **Strong grasp of programming languages:** Master at least one general-purpose programming language, such as Python, Java, or JavaScript. Familiarize yourself with other languages to broaden your skillset and explore different programming paradigms.

2. **Understanding of algorithms and data structures:** Learn about fundamental algorithms like sorting, searching, and graph algorithms. Familiarize yourself with common data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs. These concepts are essential for building efficient and scalable software.

3. **Problem-solving and analytical skills:** Develop strong problem-solving and analytical skills to break down complex problems into manageable steps. Practice identifying patterns, formulating solutions, and evaluating trade-offs.

4. **Design and architecture:** Understand software design principles and architectural patterns. Learn how to structure and organize code efficiently to ensure maintainability, scalability, and performance.

5. **Testing and debugging:** Master testing methodologies and debugging techniques to ensure the quality and reliability of your code. Learn how to write unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to catch errors and prevent bugs.

6. **Version control and collaboration:** Familiarize yourself with version control systems like Git to track changes, collaborate with others, and maintain a history of your codebase.

7. **Communication and documentation:** Develop effective communication skills to explain technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences. Learn how to write clear and concise documentation for your code.

8. **Continuous learning and adaptation:** Cultivate a mindset of continuous learning and adaptation. Stay updated with the latest technologies, trends, and best practices in the programming field.

To develop these skills, consider the following approaches:

1. **Enroll in structured courses or tutorials:** Numerous online and offline courses and tutorials can provide a structured learning path for programming fundamentals.
