Can I say that I am pretty good in programming if I can build a full stack CRUD web app using Python/Flask for the backend and React for the frontend?




--------------------------------------------------------
No. If you study tutorials on React, Flask, and Python, you will gain a basic understanding of those tools and some of the problems they solve.
However, to get pretty good in programming, you have to show yourself able to solve real-world problems which save your clients money or earn your clients money, 
and do it within limited time and money budgets. When you do that, your deep understanding of the tools is exposed and improved, your understanding of the problem domain
is tested. And your ability to meet your clients’ needs with software not encoded in the framework helps highlight you as a pretty good programmer.






--------------------------------------------------------
CRUD is only the beginning of web programming. Other answers have already mentioned SQL optimization. What do you know of real-time messaging or websockets?
Are you only using REST? What do you know of older protocols like SOAP or newer protocols like GraphQL? 
What can you tell us about your proficiency with lower-level languages like C for performance-intensive tasks?
Do you have more languages and frameworks in your toolbox?

Your familiarity with CRUD doesn’t correlate to other domains such as embedded systems, machine learning, data science,
algorithmic trading, e-commerce, or Internet of Things (among many others).
Programming is really too broad for any individual to claim anything approaching mastery in most of its domains.



-------------------------------------------------
Its about how well one understands core concepts and how one thinks or approaches a given problem.






----------------------------------------------------
  to refine the requirements, design the architecture, code the application, work with testers and ship the entire application to production with confident. 
  So your application would be clean, maintainable, expendable, scalable, testable, secure, has monitoring build in, come with CICD, and etc.




  -----------------------------------------------------------
  Assuming because you said CRUD, this involves database work, then yes.

However, you may find that specialising in one aspect may be advantageous. 
  Full Stack developers are starting to get a reputation as being no good at either front end or back end (I say this as a full stack developer myself).
  However perhaps that’s a minority opinion. And after all you will mostly answer for your own reputation instead.
