Here are some recommendations for becoming a self-taught software engineer:

**Choose a programming language.** There are many different programming languages to choose from, so it is important to select one that is in high demand and has a large community of users. Some popular programming languages include Python, JavaScript, Java, and C++.

**Learn the fundamentals of computer science.** This includes topics such as data structures, algorithms, and software design patterns. There are many online resources and books available to help you learn these topics.

**Build projects.** The best way to learn software engineering is by doing. Once you have a basic understanding of programming and computer science, start building projects. This will help you to apply what you have learned and to gain experience with different technologies.

**Contribute to open source projects.** Contributing to open source projects is a great way to gain experience working on real-world software projects. It is also a good way to network with other software engineers and to learn from their expertise.

**Get involved in the software engineering community.** There are many online and offline communities for software engineers. Getting involved in these communities can help you to learn new things, to get help with your projects, and to find job opportunities.

**Here are some specific topics and areas that you should focus on:**

* Programming language fundamentals: variables, data types, operators, control flow statements, functions, and classes
* Data structures and algorithms: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting, searching, and recursion
* Software design patterns: singleton, factory, observer, adapter, and decorator
* Object-oriented programming principles: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
* Design principles: SOLID principles, DRY principle, and KISS principle
* Testing principles: unit testing, integration testing, and system testing
* Version control systems: Git

**Here is a possible path that you can follow to become a professional software engineer:**

1. Learn the fundamentals of programming and computer science.
2. Build projects.
3. Contribute to open source projects.
4. Get involved in the software engineering community.
5. Find a job as a software engineer intern or junior software engineer.
6. Continue to learn and grow as a software engineer.

**Here are some additional tips for becoming a successful self-taught software engineer:**

* Be patient and persistent. Learning software engineering takes time and effort. Don't get discouraged if you don't understand something right away. Keep practicing and learning, and you will eventually succeed.
* Find a mentor or community of other self-taught software engineers. Having a mentor or community to support you can be very helpful. They can answer your questions, help you with your projects, and give you advice on your career.
* Don't be afraid to ask for help. If you are stuck on something, don't be afraid to ask for help from a mentor, friend, or online community.
* Keep learning and growing. The field of software engineering is constantly evolving, so it is important to keep learning new things. Read books and articles, attend conferences, and take online courses.

Becoming a self-taught software engineer is challenging, but it is possible. With hard work and dedication, you can achieve your goal of becoming a successful software engineer.
