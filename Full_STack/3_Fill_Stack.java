Based on your current skill set and your future goals as a full-stack developer, here are some recommendations:

1. **Study System Design**: Understanding how to design large scale systems is crucial for a full-stack developer. Topics like load balancing, caching, data partitioning, indexes, queues, and more are covered in system design. Resources like the "System Design Primer" on GitHub can be a good starting place [Source 0](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/how-to-become-a-full-stack-developer/).

2. **Microservices**: With your background in backend development, learning about microservices would be a natural next step. Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small autonomous services, modeled around a business domain [Source 15](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/lets-architect-designing-microservices-architectures/).

3. **AWS and Deployment**: AWS provides a broad set of products and services you can use as building blocks to run sophisticated and scalable applications. Understanding how to deploy and maintain applications on AWS will be a valuable skill. AWS has its own learning platform where you can start [Source 20](https://aws.amazon.com/training/).

4. **Design Patterns**: Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices and are a critical part of software engineering. The book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" is a classic resource.

5. **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Even though you have experience in front-end and back-end development, having a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms is crucial. This knowledge is often tested in software engineering interviews.

6. **Kubernetes**: Given your interest in deployment, learning about Kubernetes, an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, can be beneficialConsidering your current skill set and your goal to become a proficient full stack developer, you are on the right track. Here are some areas you might want to explore further:

1. **System Design**: Understanding how to design scalable and efficient systems is crucial for any full stack developer. You can start by studying common system design patterns, principles, and best practices. Resources like the [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) on GitHub can be very helpful.

2. **Microservices**: Microservices architecture is becoming increasingly popular for developing enterprise applications due to its scalability, flexibility, and ability to distribute development across teams. You can learn more about microservices from resources like [Microservices.io](https://microservices.io/).

3. **Cloud Services (AWS)**: Knowledge of cloud services like AWS is essential for modern full-stack development. AWS offers a range of services for computing, storage, databases, analytics, machine learning, and more. Amazon provides a comprehensive set of [AWS Training and Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/training/) resources to help you learn about their platform.

4. **Docker and Kubernetes**: These tools are used for containerization and orchestration, which are essential for deploying and managing applications, especially in a microservices architecture. You can learn about Docker from the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/), and Kubernetes from the [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/).

5. **Design Principles and Patterns**: Understanding common design principles and patterns can help you write more efficient and maintainable code. The book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by the Gang of Four (GoF) is a classic resource for learning about design patterns.

6. **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Even though you've already started building projects, a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms is essential for solving complex problems efficiently. Websites like LeetCode and HackerRank provide problems that you can practice on.

7. **Keep Building Projects**: Continue to apply what you learn in your projects. This will not only solidify your understanding but also give you practical experience that can be very valuable when applying for jobs.

Remember, learning all of these skills will take time, so don't rush. It's more important to understand the concepts well than to rush through them. Also, keep in mind that the learning never stops in software development, as new tools and technologies are always emerging [Source 0](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/how-to-become-a-full-stack-developer/), [Source 3](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-a-fullstack-developer/), [Source 8](https://www.scaler.com/topics/software-engineering/how-to-become-a-full-stack-developer/), [Source 9](https://www.coursera.org/articles/full-stack-developer), [Source 10](https://www.computerscience.org/careers/web-development/full-stack-developer/), [Source 13](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/top-aws-learning-plans-aws-developer-learning-plan), [Source 15](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/lets-architect-designing
