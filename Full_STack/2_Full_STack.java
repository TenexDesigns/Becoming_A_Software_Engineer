It sounds like you have a good foundation in front-end development with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, as well as back-end development with Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL. You have also had some experience with Flutter for mobile development.

To become a proficient full-stack developer for both web and mobile with Flutter and Next.js, you should focus on the following:

* **Design principles**: Learn about solid design principles, DRY principle, and KISS principle. These principles will help you to design better software that is easier to maintain and extend.
* **Microservices**: Microservices are a popular architectural style for building distributed systems. Learn about the benefits and challenges of microservices, and how to design and implement microservices-based applications.
* **System design**: Learn about system design patterns and how to design scalable and reliable systems.
* **AWS**: AWS is a leading cloud computing platform. Learn about the different AWS services and how to use them to deploy and manage your applications.
* **Deployment**: Learn about different deployment strategies, such as continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).
* **Kubernetes**: Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform. Learn about Kubernetes and how to use it to manage your containerized applications.
* **Design patterns**: Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. Learn about common design patterns and how to use them in your code.
* **Data structures**: Data structures are the building blocks of efficient algorithms. Learn about common data structures and how to use them in your code.

You can learn about these topics through books, articles, online courses, and tutorials. You can also gain experience by building projects that incorporate these concepts.

Here are some specific things you can do to supplement your knowledge of the tools and frameworks you have already learned:

* **Next.js:** Learn about the advanced features of Next.js, such as incremental static regeneration (ISR) and server-side rendering (SSR).
* **Rails:** Learn about the advanced features of Rails, such as Active Record associations and Active Model Serializers.
* **Flutter:** Learn about the advanced features of Flutter, such as state management and widget building.

It is important to avoid over-learning. Focus on learning the things that are most relevant to your current goals. Once you have a good understanding of the fundamentals, you can start to learn more advanced topics.

Becoming a proficient full-stack developer takes time and effort, but it is definitely possible. By following the advice above, you can put yourself on the path to becoming a successful software engineer.

Here are some additional tips:

* Find a mentor or community of other software developers. Having a mentor or community to support you can be very helpful. They can answer your questions, help you with your projects, and give you advice on your career.
* Contribute to open source projects. Contributing to open source projects is a great way to gain experience working on real-world software projects. It is also a good way to network with other software developers and to learn from their expertise.
* Continue to learn and grow. The field of software engineering is constantly evolving, so it is important to keep learning new things. Read books and articles, attend conferences, and take online courses.

I wish you the best of luck on your journey to becoming a proficient full-stack software engineer!
