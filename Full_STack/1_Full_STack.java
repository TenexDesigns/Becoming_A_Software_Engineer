In the above context, "help me out and advice me on this journey to become a profient software enginner,  I have studies front end development with javascript, 
  react, next js, tails wind, html css,  I have three projects on front end , one for static hospictal web page with next js and tailwind and deployed it and its  
  live, same with my porfolio website in next js and tailwind, I have also done baclend with ruby on rails and postgre,  and have developed apis, but not yet completed learning backedn , I also have done flutter for mobile development and have created some static apps, But I would like to become a full stack develper for both mobile with flutter and front end with next js and tailsing or reach if need,  thats where I am as a software eenginner, but what mor cn I do, is it study design principles, microservices, system design for apps, aws,  deploymwnt, kubernates, design pattermns, data stures, since I have not done many of this, because I was learning the tools and framworks like next js rails, do I nned to supliment my knowlage of this ttolls and with what and how and to what extend to avoid ove
  r laerning and still become a proficent and compnt software develper, fiull stack develope for web abd appp with flutter"

It's great to see that you've already made substantial progress in your journey to become a proficient software engineer with expertise in front-end, back-end, and mobile development. To further enhance your skills and knowledge, here's a roadmap that can help you become a full-stack developer while avoiding overlearning:

**1. Consolidate Your Current Knowledge:**
   - Make sure you have a strong foundation in the technologies you've already learned, such as JavaScript, React, Next.js, Ruby on Rails, and Flutter. Work on more advanced projects and ensure you understand these technologies thoroughly.

**2. Expand Your Back-End Knowledge:**
   - Since you've started with Ruby on Rails, continue to deepen your understanding of back-end development. Learn about RESTful APIs, authentication and authorization, databases, and database optimization.

**3. Focus on Full-Stack Development:**
   - To become a full-stack developer, strengthen your ability to connect the front-end and back-end. Practice integrating your front-end applications with the APIs you develop in the back-end.

**4. Study System Design:**
   - As you progress, it's essential to learn about system design and architecture. Understand how to design scalable, efficient, and reliable systems.

**5. Learn Data Structures and Algorithms:**
   - Building a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms can help you with problem-solving and optimizing code in both front-end and back-end development.

**6. Study Design Principles:**
   - UI/UX design principles are valuable for front-end development. Learn about user interface design, usability, and responsive design to create user-friendly web and mobile apps.

**7. Explore Deployment and Cloud Services:**
   - Learn about deployment and cloud services like AWS, Heroku, and Netlify. Understanding how to deploy your applications to various environments is crucial.

**8. Dive into Microservices:**
   - Microservices architecture is a valuable concept for building scalable and modular systems. It's worth exploring when you're comfortable with monolithic applications.

**9. Kubernetes and Containerization:**
   - Understanding Kubernetes and containerization can be beneficial for deploying and managing applications at scale. However, you can delve into this when you have a clear need for it.

**10. Design Patterns:**
   - Learn software design patterns to enhance your coding skills and develop maintainable and scalable applications. Patterns like MVC (Model-View-Controller) are essential in web development.

**11. Continuous Learning:**
   - Keep up with industry trends and emerging technologies. The tech world evolves rapidly, so staying informed is crucial.

**12. Work on Real Projects:**
   - Apply your knowledge by working on real-world projects. The more you build, the more you'll learn and improve your skills.

**13. Seek Mentorship and Collaborate:**
   - Consider finding a mentor or collaborating with experienced developers on projects. They can provide guidance and help you learn faster.

**14. Avoid Overlearning:**
   - Be strategic in your learning. Focus on what you need for your projects and career goals. Overlearning can lead to frustration and hinder progress.

**15. Set Clear Goals:**
   - Define your career goals and set milestones. Having clear objectives will keep you motivated and ensure you're making progress.

Remember, becoming a proficient full-stack developer is a journey that takes time. It's normal to feel overwhelmed with the vast amount of knowledge in software development. Focus on your goals, prioritize what's relevant to your current projects and career path, and learn incrementally. As you gain experience and knowledge, you'll become more confident and proficient as a software engineer.
