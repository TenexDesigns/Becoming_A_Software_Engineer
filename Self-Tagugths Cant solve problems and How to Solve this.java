It's not uncommon for self-taught programmers to face challenges in problem-solving, especially if they haven't had formal education in computer science or software engineering. However, the good news is that problem-solving skills can be developed and improved over time. Here are some tips to help you enhance your programming problem-solving abilities:

1. **Practice Regularly:**
   - Consistent practice is key to improving any skill, including problem-solving. Solve a variety of programming challenges on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeSignal.

2. **Understand Fundamentals:**
   - Take the time to study fundamental concepts in computer science such as data structures, algorithms, and design patterns. There are many online resources, tutorials, and books available for self-learners.

3. **Read Code:**
   - Review code written by experienced developers. Understand how they approach and solve problems. Open-source projects on platforms like GitHub can be a valuable resource for learning different coding styles and techniques.

4. **Learn Data Structures and Algorithms:**
   - Understanding how data structures work and being familiar with common algorithms will significantly improve your problem-solving skills. There are many resources, both online and in books, that explain these concepts with practical examples.

5. **Break Down Problems:**
   - When faced with a problem, break it down into smaller, more manageable parts. Solve each part separately before combining them to solve the overall problem. This approach is known as "divide and conquer."

6. **Work on Projects:**
   - Build real-world projects. This not only helps you apply your programming skills but also exposes you to problem-solving scenarios that mimic those you might encounter in a professional setting.

7. **Join Coding Communities:**
   - Participate in online coding communities and forums. Discussing problems with others and seeing different solutions can provide valuable insights and alternative perspectives.

8. **Ask for Feedback:**
   - Don't hesitate to seek feedback on your code. Platforms like Code Review Stack Exchange are dedicated to providing constructive feedback on code snippets.

9. **Read Books on Problem Solving:**
   - There are several books that focus on improving problem-solving skills, such as "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell and "The Pragmatic Programmer" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas.

10. **Take Online Courses:**
    - Consider taking online courses in computer science and algorithms. Websites like Coursera, edX, and Khan Academy offer courses from top universities.

Remember, improvement takes time and consistent effort. Be patient with yourself, and don't be afraid to tackle challenging problems. Gradually, you'll build confidence and enhance your problem-solving skills.

  If you are a self-taught programmer and are facing difficulties in solving programming problems, there are several steps you can take to improve your problem-solving skills:

1. Strengthen your fundamentals: As mentioned, self-taught programmers may not have learned the fundamentals of computer science and software engineering. It would be beneficial to invest time in learning these concepts. You can find online resources, tutorials, and books that cover topics such as algorithms, data structures, object-oriented programming, and design patterns.

2. Practice problem-solving: Solving programming problems requires practice. Look for coding challenges, puzzles, or exercises that focus on problem-solving skills. Websites like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeSignal offer a wide range of coding challenges to help you improve your problem-solving abilities.

3. Analyze and understand existing code: When working with frameworks or libraries, take the time to analyze and understand the code you are using. This will help you gain insights into how the framework works and how to solve problems within its context.

4. Seek guidance and mentorship: Consider finding a mentor or joining a programming community where you can seek guidance and learn from experienced programmers. Engaging in discussions, asking questions, and receiving feedback can greatly enhance your problem-solving skills.

5. Break down problems into smaller tasks: When faced with a complex problem, break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks. This approach, known as "divide and conquer," allows you to tackle each subtask individually and then combine the solutions to solve the larger problem.

6. Learn from others: Read code written by experienced programmers, study open-source projects, and participate in code reviews. This exposure to different coding styles and problem-solving techniques can broaden your understanding and improve your own problem-solving abilities.

7. Reflect and learn from mistakes: Don't be discouraged by mistakes or failures. Instead, view them as opportunities for growth and learning. Take the time to analyze your mistakes, understand why they occurred, and find ways to improve your approach in the future.

Remember, problem-solving is a skill that develops over time with practice and experience. By focusing on strengthening your fundamentals, practicing regularly, seeking guidance, and learning from mistakes, you can improve your ability to solve programming problems effectively.

I understand your concern. It is true that some self-taught programmers may not have the same level of fundamental knowledge as those who have studied computer science in a formal setting. However, this does not mean that self-taught programmers are incapable of solving programming problems.

There are many ways to learn the fundamentals of computer science and software engineering outside of a university setting. There are many online courses, books, and tutorials that can teach you the basics of programming, algorithms, data structures, and software design. Additionally, there are many open source projects that you can contribute to in order to gain practical experience.

The key is to be willing to learn and to practice consistently. If you are dedicated to learning programming, you can overcome any obstacle.

Here are some tips for self-taught programmers who want to improve their problem-solving skills:

* **Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable problems.** This will make them seem less daunting and help you to identify potential solutions.
* **Think about how you would solve the problem if you had unlimited time and resources.** This will help you to come up with creative solutions that you might not have thought of otherwise.
* **Don't be afraid to ask for help.** There are many online forums and communities where you can ask questions and get help from other programmers.
* **Practice regularly.** The more you practice, the better you will become at solving programming problems.
